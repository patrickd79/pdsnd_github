Bike Share Python Project

This is a python program that takes user input and returns data relating to bike share usage in 3 cities. The cities where the data comes from are: Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.. The data can be parsed by city, day of the week, and month. It returns statistics regarding usage by time, locations, and users. 



The data files include 3 .csv files (washington.csv, chicago,csv, and new_york_city.csv) containing usage data for the period from Jan-June, the program itself bikeshare_2.py, and a README.md document. 

This is a list of reference sources I used to assist me in completing this project.
